# All of this code is based on the Exec builtin type.
#
# The code complexity in both Exec and in this derived Wait_for type
# comes from supporting the refreshonly concept, which does not fit
# Puppet's type/provider model. The hack in Exec and here is to not
# use the provider at all, and have the types themselves do most of
# the work.
#
# The Mixins module is used in the Wait_for type only to reuse the
# retrieve and sync methods. This is one point of departure from Exec.
# In Exec, retrieve and sync are defined only once on the :returns
# property. Here, they need to be defined on :exit_code, :query and
# :seconds.
